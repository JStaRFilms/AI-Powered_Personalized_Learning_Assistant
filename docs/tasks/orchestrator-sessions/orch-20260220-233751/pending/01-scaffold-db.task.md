## 🔧 Agent Setup (DO THIS FIRST)

### 1. Prime Agent Context
> **MANDATORY:** Run `/vibe-primeAgent` first to load project Coding Guidelines from `docs/Coding_Guidelines.md`

### 2. Workflow to Follow
> **Load:** `cat .agent/workflows/vibe-build.md`
> 
> This is the core scaffolding workflow. Follow its verification gates.

### 3. Required Skills
| Skill | Path | Why Required |
|-------|------|--------------|
| `nextjs-standards` | `~/.kilocode/skills/nextjs-standards/SKILL.md` | Core framework architecture, App Router paradigms, Tailwind setup |

### 4. Reference Documents
| Document | Path | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Core Architecture | `docs/features/CoreArchitecture.md` | Database schema models |
| Coding Guidelines | `docs/Coding_Guidelines.md` | Project standards |
| Design System | `docs/design/design-system.html` | Visual reference |

## 📋 Objective
Initialize the Next.js App Router codebase, establish the Tailwind CSS design system shell, and configure Prisma ORM hooked up to the Neon serverless PostgreSQL database.

## 🎯 Scope

**In Scope:**
- `npx create-next-app@latest` (TypeScript, Tailwind, ESLint, App Router)
- Initialize Prisma `npx prisma init`
- Update `prisma/schema.prisma` with base models (`User`, `Document`, `Conversation`) as outlined in Core Architecture
- Set up `.env` file structure (Neon `DATABASE_URL`)
- Basic Tailwind `globals.css` structure

**Out of Scope:**
- Authentication implementation (Task 02)
- UI components (Task 03)
- Vector extensions setup (Task 05)

## 📚 Context
This is the foundational setup for the AI-Powered Personalized Learning Assistant. The project relies on Neon for database operations, meaning Prisma must be configured to work with PostgreSQL, and we will eventually need `pgvector` support. The application is purely a responsive web app.

## ✅ Definition of Done
- [ ] Next.js app compiles and runs cleanly on `localhost:3000`
- [ ] Database schema is defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`
- [ ] Prisma client is generated (`npx prisma generate`)
- [ ] Basic Tailwind `globals.css` structure is established without generic colors
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode is enabled

## 📁 Expected Artifacts
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `package.json` | Project dependencies |
| `prisma/schema.prisma` | Database schema with User, Document, Conversation models |
| `app/layout.tsx` | Root layout |
| `app/globals.css` | Tailwind base styles |
| `.env.example` | Environment variable template |

## 🚫 Constraints
- ONLY perform the work outlined above
- Do NOT implement authentication or UI components
- Do NOT deviate from the specified scope
- Signal completion using `attempt_completion` tool
- Create `01-scaffold-db.result.md` file in `docs/tasks/orchestrator-sessions/orch-20260220-233751/completed/` when complete
