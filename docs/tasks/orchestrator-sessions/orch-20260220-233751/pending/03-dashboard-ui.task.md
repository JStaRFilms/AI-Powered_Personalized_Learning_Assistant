## 📋 Objective
Establish the foundational responsive Dashboard layout where a user can view their tracked progress and interact with features.

## 🎯 Scope

**In Scope:**
- Create overall application layout shell (header, sidebar/nav, main content area) for authenticated users
- Build Dashboard overview page (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- Fetch user session and display personalized information (name, simulated mastery metrics) using Prisma
- Implement clear call-to-action sections for uploading materials and accessing chat UI
- Responsive design for web (mobile-first approach)

**Out of Scope:**
- Real-time analytics (future enhancement)
- Topic mastery visualization (depends on RAG pipeline)
- Settings page (separate task)

## 📚 Context
See FR-002 in `docs/issues/FR-002.md`. The design should prioritize visual excellence—do not settle for generic layout shells. It must feel premium and interactive while remaining fully responsive for web. Reference `docs/mockups/dashboard.html` for the intended visual direction.

## ✅ Definition of Done
- [ ] Authenticated application layout shell is built and functional
- [ ] Dashboard route successfully retrieves session and basic mock/real metrics from Postgres DB
- [ ] Dashboard offers obvious entry points into student's workflow (uploading & chatting)
- [ ] UI matches design system from `docs/mockups/dashboard.html`
- [ ] Fully responsive on desktop and tablet viewports
- [ ] Navigation works correctly between sections

## 📁 Expected Artifacts
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` | Dashboard layout shell with nav |
| `app/dashboard/page.tsx` | Main dashboard overview |
| `components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` | Navigation sidebar |
| `components/layout/Header.tsx` | Top header with user menu |
| `components/dashboard/StatsCard.tsx` | Metric display cards |
| `components/dashboard/QuickActions.tsx` | CTA buttons |

## 🚫 Constraints
- ONLY perform the work outlined above
- Do NOT implement real analytics (mock data is acceptable)
- Do NOT deviate from the specified scope
- Signal completion using `attempt_completion` tool
- Create `03-dashboard-ui.result.md` file in `docs/tasks/orchestrator-sessions/orch-20260220-233751/completed/` when complete
