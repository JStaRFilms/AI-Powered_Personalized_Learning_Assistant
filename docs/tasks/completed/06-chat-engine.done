# Task Completion Summary

**Task:** 06-chat-engine
**Completed At:** 2026-02-21T18:01:04+01:00
**Mode:** Code

## Results

Implemented a responsive AI Chat Interface using the latest Vercel AI SDK (`v6`). 
Configured the `app/api/chat/route.ts` to perform RAG retrieval from Neon Postgres (`pgvector`) and stream responses using OpenRouter.
The implementation properly uses `DefaultChatTransport` due to new AI SDK architectural changes and correctly extracts user messages from the payload.
Conversations are saved/upserted to the Prisma database attached to the user session.

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/components/chat/ChatInterface.tsx` - Created UI component matching requirements.
- `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` - Created backend Route handler connecting AI stream to DB logs.
- `package.json` - Added `@ai-sdk/react` and `@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider`.
- `docs/issues/FR-005.md` - Marked complete.

## Verification Status

- [x] TypeScript: PASS
- [x] Lint: PASS
- [x] Build: PASS
- [x] Tests: NA

## Notes

AI SDK `useChat` hook was updated to Vercel AI SDK version 6 architecture using explicit Transports.
