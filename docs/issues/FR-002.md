# [FR-002] Dashboard & Progress Overview

## Labels
`MUS`, `enhancement`, `dashboard`

## User Story
As a student, I want to see my topic mastery and recent activity so I know where I stand.

## Proposed Solution

### Overview
Create a responsive React (Next.js App Router) dashboard that aggregates the student's progress. It will fetch data from the Postgres database (via Prisma) to display their recent conversations, uploaded materials, and a conceptual visual representation of their overall mastery.

### Implementation Flow
1. Fetch user session using `better-auth` on the server component `app/dashboard/page.tsx`.
2. Query Prisma for recent `Conversation` records linked to the user.
3. Query Prisma for recent `Document` uploads.
4. Display a summary of their metrics using standard Tailwind CSS styling following the project's design system.
5. Provide clear Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons to "Start Chat" or "Upload Material".

### Technical Approach

```tsx
// Suggested approach for Dashboard Server Component Let's fetch the data directly
import { auth } from "@/lib/auth";
import { headers } from "next/headers";
import prisma from "@/lib/prisma";

export default async function DashboardPage() {
  const session = await auth.api.getSession({
    headers: await headers(),
  });
  
  // If no session, middleware should have caught this, but good to handle
  if (!session) return <div>Unauthorized</div>;

  const recentDocs = await prisma.document.findMany({
      where: { /* Assuming we add userId to Document later, or it's global for MVP */ },
      take: 5,
      orderBy: { id: 'desc' }
  });

  return (
    <main className="p-8">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold">Welcome back, {session.user.name}</h1>
      {/* Render recentDocs, metrics, and CTAs */}
    </main>
  );
}
```

### Key Considerations
- Keep the UI clean and strictly mobile-responsive.
- For the MVP, if we don't have complex `TopicMastery` calculations yet, use placeholder UI for the "Mastery" section, prioritizing the functional RAG and upload flows.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dashboard is only accessible to authenticated users.
- [ ] Dashboard displays the user's name.
- [ ] Dashboard contains links to navigate to the Chat and Upload interfaces.
