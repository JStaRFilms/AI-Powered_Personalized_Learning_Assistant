# Task Completion Summary

**Task:** 05-rag-pipeline
**Mode:** Code

## Results
Implemented the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) backend engine, allowing raw document text to be correctly vectorized using Vercel AI SDK and stored securely in the Neon Postgres database (`pgvector`). Added the retrieval function `findSimilarContext` that fetches nearest neighbor vectors based on the user's query context.

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/lib/knowledge.service.ts` - Implemented core vectorization and SQL vector storage/retrieval.
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added `DocumentEmbedding` schema with `Unsupported("vector(1536)")`.
- `.env` - Kept updated Neon database connection.

## Verification Status
- [x] TypeScript: PASS
- [x] Dependencies Loaded: PASS
- [x] Database Schema pushed: PASS

Ready for orchestrator review.
